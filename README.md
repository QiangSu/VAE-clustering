# RNA-seq Multi-dimensional RNA Structure Sequencing Analysis Toolkit
This repository provides a VAE–GMM–based pipeline for exploring how RNA structure impacts reverse transcription (RT) efficiency in RNA-seq experiments, complemented by GC content-based and MFE-based Gaussian distribution models for additional structure-related analyses. By combining Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), the pipeline effectively captures high-dimensional k-mer patterns reflecting both RNA secondary and tertiary structures, revealing how they influence sequencing biases during RT. 

Usage
The tools within this toolkit can be used individually or in combination depending on the specific needs of your RNA-seq data analysis pipeline. Ensure to have the required dependencies installed for each script, including R, Python, and MATLAB environments, as necessary.

## Python Script: `kmer_clustering_VAEs_KL_GMM.py`

**Description:**  
This Python script performs Variational Autoencoder (VAE)–based dimensionality reduction followed by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering on k-mer sequences. By first learning a low-dimensional latent representation of one-hot–encoded k-mers, the script can either use a user-specified number of clusters or automatically determine an optimal number of clusters by scanning for the best Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). It also offers UMAP visualization of clustered k-mers and supports highlighting specific clusters of interest.

**Usage:**  
running VAE-GMM script
```python
python kmer_clustering_VAEs_KL_GMM.py \
    --input <input_file> \
    --output <output_file> \
    --plot-output <a PNG file> \
    --clusters <cluster_number> \
    [--highlight-clusters <list_of_clusters>] \
    [--bic-output <bic_info_file>] 
```
- --input: Path to the input CSV or TSV file containing a kmer column.
- --output: Name (and path) of the output CSV where cluster assignments and scores will be saved.
- --clusters (optional): If provided, the GMM will use exactly that many components for clustering; if omitted, the script will scan k=2..30 and pick the best k by BIC.
- --highlight-clusters (optional): Space-separated cluster IDs to highlight in the UMAP plot (e.g., 0 3 5).
- --bic-output (optional): If provided (and no fixed --clusters specified), writes per-cluster BIC scores and the chosen best cluster size to a text file.

**Key Features:**  
- VAE Dimensionality Reduction: Learns compressed representations of k-mers, capturing key structural or sequence patterns.
- Flexible or Fixed Clustering: Either specify --clusters directly or let the script automatically find the best number of clusters via BIC.
- UMAP Visualization: Generates a 2D projection of the latent space, colored by cluster labels, with optional highlighting of specific clusters.
- Silhouette Score: Outputs a silhouette score to gauge the quality of clustering.
- BIC Logging: If scanning for clusters, logs the BIC values for each tested cluster number and notes the optimal choice.
